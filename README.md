Saying hello again, it's been a while

Hey fellow beings!

Izzie here (she/they), relearning html/css/javascript and excited for the journey into programming. My path has not been linear, but that's made me more determined. When I'm not learning to code, I'm illustrating on procreate, reading scifi/fantasy from the public library, or watching the latest foreign tv show on Netflix.
